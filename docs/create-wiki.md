## Create a wiki

There are multiple ways to create a wiki, you need two parts:
    - the articles with information and styles. As frontend.
    - a database with collaboratos, logins and permissions. As backend. The database can be:
        * Integrated: database in the same project like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) or [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) that use MediaWiki as CMS.
        * External: database managed by an external application, by the same team or an external tea. Like [Hyprland wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/) that uses GitHub for hosting the website acting as database to manage collabaratos and commits.
