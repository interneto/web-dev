## Document Object Model (DOM) 

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree-like structure, where each element in the document is represented as a node in the tree.

In the DOM, each node in the tree is an object with properties and methods that can be manipulated through code. These nodes can represent different types of elements in the document, such as text, images, links, forms, and more.

The DOM is commonly used in client-side web development to dynamically manipulate the contents of a web page based on user input or other events. For example, JavaScript can be used to traverse the DOM and modify the properties of individual elements, such as changing the text content of a heading or adding a new element to the page.

Overall, the DOM provides a powerful and flexible way for developers to interact with and manipulate the contents of a web page, making it a fundamental part of modern web development.
